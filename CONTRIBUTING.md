How to contribute

What should I know before getting started?

First of all thanks for taking the time to contribute to our project. We are happy to welcome contributors and we really value the time and effort you take to work with us on this project.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

Contributing Guidelines

We have set some clear contribution guidelines to make it easier for you to get involved.
The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

Community matters

One of the things that makes open source so amazing is the community! As part of our community we want you to not only feel welcome but also respected and appreciated as a contributor.

We have a Code of Conduct (./code_of_conduct.md) which will be enforced in all aspects of the project. Please make sure you read it before getting started.

How can I help?

If you want to get a feel of the things that are still in progress please visit the issues section of this repository.



The issues there will be labelled according to the level of support/help it needs. It can be anything from a general question aiming for a discussion or brainstorming to something like helping a member of our team with specific tasks.

Make a change

Once you've identified something you'd like to help with you're ready to make a change to the project repository!

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a comment to the issue, (and this might mean making a new issue).

    This blog (https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

2. Fork this repository to your profile.

    You can now do whatever you want with this copy of the project. You won't mess up anyone else's work so you're super safe.

    Make sure to keep your fork up to date (https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser) with the master repository.

3. Make the changes you've discussed.

    Try to keep the changes focused rather than changing lots of things at once. If you feel tempted to branch out then please *literally* branch out: create separate branches for different updates to make the next step much easier!

4. Submit a pull request.

    A member of the executive team will review your changes, have a bit of discussion, and hopefully merge them in!  
    
    N.B. you don't have to be ready to merge to make a pull request! We encourage you to submit a pull request as early as you want to. They help us to keep track of progress and help you to get earlier feedback.
