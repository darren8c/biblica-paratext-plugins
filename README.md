Welcome to The ParaText Plugins Project

We also call this the "Digital Toolbox", because the plugins are a grab-bag of
useful tools to extend the capabilities of ParaText.

As of January 1, 2022, the Digital Toolbox is comprised of 2 plugins:
  1. The Plugin Manager Plugin (or, affectionately, The Plugin to Rule Them All)
  2. The Typesetting Preview Tool (TPT)
  3. The Translation Validation Plugin (TVP)
and is compatible with ParaText versions 9.1 and 9.2

Each plugin is documented in more detail in the User Procedures directory

The Digital Toolbox was originally built by Biblica, with funding generously
provided by Every Tribe, Every Nation (ETEN), and is made available as Open
Source software, under the MIT license.

We welcome your assistance in making this toolbox more robust and more useful.
Please contribute your enhancements, thoughts, ideas and unique plugins.

One vital enhancement that we have not been able to make is to enable TVP to write
back to the ParaText project it is working on. It is designed to not just
detect errors in a Bible translation, but provide recommended changes as well.
With write-back functionality, those changes can be applied automatically to The
text, further streamlining the work of the Bible translator.
